            <li>Does it seem to be bug-free, or were there obvious problems during the presentation?</li>
            <li>Did the team show you everything their app could do, or were they selling you vaporware?</li>

        </li>
        <li>Technical Difficulty - 1 to 5 points
          <ul>

            <li>Did you know this was even possible?</li>
            <li>Were you surprised they would attempt something so ambitious, or was this something any highschooler could do on a weekend?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Originality - 1 to 5
          <ul>
            <li>Does this hack break new ground, or is it simply parroting an existing product?</li>
            <li>Did you learn something new by watching the presentation?</li>
            <li>If itâ€™s based on an existing product, does it improve its predecessor in some meaningful way?</li>

        </li>
        <li>Pure Awesomeness - <b>1 to 15</b> points

            <li>Is it beautiful?</li>
            <li>Did your jaw drop?</li>
