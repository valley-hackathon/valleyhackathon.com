        A Mini-Hack is a shorter and generally less intense form of a hackathon.  In this case we are going to holding the event for 12 hours with 10 or so hours of programming and a couple of hours for setup and presentations.  Where a full hackathon generally has judges and a lot of sponsors.  This hackathon is going to have a very few dedicated sponsors and no judges.  Just a day to come out and hack.  Food, drink, and internet will be provided.</p>
      <p>Something different about this hack compared to the Valley Hackathon is that we are going to have some pre-defined problems for you to work on.  You don't have to do them, but they will provide easy targets for those who don't want to plan something larger.  Since we are in the valley we are going to target some agriculture related projects.</p>
      <p>Really this is just a day for the community to get together and hack together.  So come on out bring your laptop and have fun!</p>

      <p>NO EXPERIENCE IS NECESSARY, PLEASE COME AND ENJOY A DAY OF PROGRAMMING WITH US.  We are limiting the signups to 10 teams of two so signup early.  Teams will be taken before individual signups so find a partner and drop us a line.  If we have open spots individuals will be allowed, but with only 10 team openings it will likely fill up quickly.</p>
      <p>If you want to just come out and hang with us, write some code, and not present anything that is great too.  Just let us know you are coming so we can plan for food.</p>

      <p>Ultimately you can do whatever you would like to do for a project but we are theming this event toward agricultural apps.  Projects can be pure software or they can be software + hardware.  Want to build a drone that does something?  Want to use a Raspberry-Pi, Arduino, or Tessel in your project?  Go for it!  In keeping with the theme here are some ideas for projects.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An online SDS database (This used to be MSDS but has a new name and new format - globally harmonized or something)</li>
        <li>An online chemical application system for easily filling out reports when chemicals are applied to a crop.  It would be cool if this and others could use Google Maps to show the locations of various fields and blocks.</li>
        <li>Harvest Scheduler - A system to define the various fields for a given agricultural interest and then schedule the harvest of those fields.  This would mean scheduling equipment or outside contractors to do the work, maybe pickup service.</li>
        <li>Water management program: type of irrigation (flood, micros, impact...), blocks, run times, usage, maintenance.</li>
        <li>Pest Trap History</li>
      </ul>
