        A Mini-Hack is a shorter and generally less intense form of a hackathon.  In this case we are going to holding the event for 12 hours with 10 or so hours of programming and a couple of hours for setup and presentations.  Where a full hackathon generally has judges and a lot of sponsors.  This hackathon is going to have a very few dedicated sponsors and no judges.  Just a day to come out and hack.  Food, drink, and internet will be provided.</p>
      <p>Something different about this hack compared to the Valley Hackathon is that we are going to have some pre-defined problems for you to work on.  You don't have to do them, but they will provide easy targets for those who don't want to plan something larger.  Since we are in the valley we are going to target some agriculture related projects.</p>
      <p>Really this is just a day for the community to get together and hack together.  So come on out bring your laptop and have fun.</p>
